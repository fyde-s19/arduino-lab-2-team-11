1. The dimmer decreases the duty cycle of the LED and we see a rapid changing in the LED state (ON, OFF, ON, OFF). 
Took about 1.4 seconds for a full cycle, ~.1 seconds to execute Read Sensors?
Advatange of logic analyzer debugging, multiple channels, can read different sorts of signals, reads time for signals, can operate like an osciloscope
Advatanges of serial monitor debugging: its convenient, already built into the program (at least in this case), can easily read pin data.
When measuring the voltages, we need to minimize variance in ground levels so that they are giving an accurate relative voltage measurement.
